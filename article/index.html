    <header>THE THREE APPLE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD</header>
    <article>
      <p>
       I was having my daily
        snack and all of sudden
        something strikes
        my mind; I wonder what
        if the apple I was eating
        may be the 4 th apple
        that will change the
        world. Yes, it may sound
        funny but why it can’t be
        the 4 th apple, it has got
        all those qualities that
        apple needs compared to
        the past history making
        apple that changed world. Wondering what were
        those apples, Let’s find out. The first apple was the
        apple that made Isaac Newton discover gravity.
        The second apple was the Apple iPhone which
        was designed by Steve Jobs. The third apple was
        the apple or the fruit mentioned in Bible Genesis
        Chapter 3 or the so-called “Eve’s apple”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first apple that changed the world was the apple
        that made Newton discover gravity. One day,
        the young Newton sat beneath an apple tree and
        looked at the mysterious universe. Suddenly, an
        apple hit him on the head. He shouted and understood
        that the very same force that brought
        the apple crashing toward the ground also kept
        and prevented the moon from falling toward the
        Earth and the Earth from falling toward the sun. This is the force of gravity. Newton’s apple taught
        us a lot of lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, millions saw the apple fall but Newton
        was the one who asked “why”. This shows the
        importance of curiosity. We should always ask
        the six “wh” questions, especially the question of
        “why”. In so doing, we would discover a lot of new
        knowledge. Secondly, Newton said that “no great
        discovery was ever made without a bold guess”.
        So, try to think out of the box. Trial and error are
        important for the discovery of new knowledge.
        Thirdly, from his “apple falling due to gravity”
        theory, Newton concluded, “Whatever goes up,
        must come down!” In other words, Newton reminded
        all of us to be humble. Please do not think
        that you are as important as other people. Don’t
        think too highly of yourself. Try to respect others.
        Fourthly, Newton said, “I have a fundamental
        belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by
        men who were inspired. I study the Bible daily.”
        So, try to follow Newton and respect God.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second apple that changed the world was the
        Apple iPhone which was designed by Steve Jobs.
        His invention of the I product changed the whole
        world of technology. In 2007, the Apple Company
        designed and marketed the iPhone. According to
        Steve Jobs, iPhone was target-oriented and people-
        oriented. The word “i” in “iPhone” (as well
        as in “iMac”, “iPod” and “iPad”) stands for five
        things. They are the so-called five “i”s. The first “i”
        stands for “internet”. Internet is the global system
        of interconnected computer networks. It carries a
        vast range of information, resources and services.
        The second “i” stands for “individual”. The iPhone
        is designed for one person. It is unique and people-
        oriented. The third “i” stands for “instruct”.
        The iPhone aims at teaching people a practical
        skill. The fourth “i” stands for “inform”. The iPhone
        aims at telling people different data. The fifth
        “i” stands for “inspire”. The iPhone is designed to
        give people artistic or imaginative ideas. Boys
        and girls, learn from Steve Jobs, be target-oriented
        and people-oriented. When you work on any
        tasks, make sure you have a target before you and
        you are working toward the target. Also, make
        sure what you do is good and beneficial to the
        well-being of other people. Even though he was
        kicked from his own company he didn’t lost his
        hope to change the world which lead to development
        of 1 st animated film “toy story”. Through
        this we can learn his dedication and “never lose
        hope attitude” as he was again re signed as CEO
        of Apple.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third apple that changed the world was the
        apple or the fruit mentioned in the Bible, Genesis
        Chapter 3 or the so-called “Eve’s apple”. In
        fact, there is no mention of Adam and Eve eating
        an apple in the Bible. The fruit mentioned in Bible
        may not be an apple. Anyway, by eating the
        forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve commi ted a sin.
        If they did not have a sinful nature yet, why did
        Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit? Adam and
        Eve were the first people to not read the Apple
        terms and conditions. According to the Bible, the
        penalty of sin is death. But God showed grace
        toward Adam and Eve. He still oved Adam and
        Eve so He made garments of skin for Adam and
        Eve and clothed them. God’s love for people is everlasting.
        His love is long, wide, high and deep.
        God’s love is long. He loved people in the past.
        He loves people now. He’ll still love human beings
        in the future. God’s love is wide. It covers a wide
        range of people. Regardless of race, appearance,
        wealth and social status, God loves all people.
        God’s love is high. God’s love for us is high-order
        and high-level. God’s love is deep. He cares for us
        physically and spiritually. In conclusion, boys and
        girls, apple is not just a fruit. It does not only contain
        a lot of vitamins. It can also teach us a lot of
        lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learn from Newton’s apple the importance of
        curiosity and humility. Be curious and humble.
        Learn from Steve Jobs’ iPhone the importance of
        being target-oriented and people-oriented. Learn
        from Adam and Eve’s apple or fruit the great love
        of God.

    <header>WHY ARE WE PREJUDICED TOWARDS LGBTQ COMMUNITY ?</header>
    <article>
      <p>
                This Covid situation has given us a lot of time to stay by ourselves
        and think. I’ve been thinking about a lot of stuff, especially
        about myself. At this point I’ve summarized my entire life and my
        gradual development. Thinking back, I’ve been a very bad human
        being. I was arrogant, greedy, hypocrite, racist, sexist, transphobic,
        homophobic and what not. All this before the age of 16. On digging
        deep, I asked myself why I was prejudiced towards people based on
        their gender or sexuality? It’s not something we choose. Also, they
        have done us no harm. To be honest gay men are actually a huge
        relief to me. They take off all the handsome and even leave the cute
        girls. That was a joke, laugh it off! So, coming back to the point.
        Why was I prejudiced? It’s not the law of our country for sure. Infact, Nepal is amongst the early countries in
        Asia and the first country in South Asia to recognize and give legal support and rights to people of LGBTQ
        community. LGBTQ rights in Nepal are among the most progressive in Asia.
              </p>
      <p>
                  The Nepalese Constitution
          recognizes LGBTQ rights as fundamental rights. Compared to most developing nations in the world, Nepal
          is miles ahead. It has been legal in Nepal since 2007 AD. Discrimination based on sexuality is prohibited by
          law and third gender is recognized. Even service of LGBTQ people in the military is taken into consideration.
          Same sex family rights might not be as developed as other developed countries but for a country like Nepal
          which is still under poverty and is categorized as a developing nation, it is a huge step towards the right path.
          The country isn’t prejudiced so why am I?So, then I questioned my upbringing or the way I grew up. I still remember
          when I was still in primary school, the Vyākarana (Nepali grammar) book had a picture of a person
          with a half man in prime and another half with woman in prime which was labeled as Chakkā. Remember this
          is the worst homophobic and transphobic slur to exist in Nepal. Everyone in the class including the teacher
          and me laughed it off like it was the funniest thing. Imagine a minority being treated as a joke, not anywhere
          else but in the textbook of primary school students. Imagine the impact it would have on the student of such
          a tender age. Who should we blame? The one who wrote the book? The one who published? The one who approved
          to publish it? Or the one who approved it as a text book for the school?
      </p>
      <p>
        This demeaning homophobic
        Why are we
        prejudiced
        towards
        LGBTQ
        community?
        Article
        slur was used by me often. Either as a joke, either during a heated argument or to address a slightly feminine
        male friend of mine. The slur was always funny when used by me and was a huge shame if used on me! I
        never understood the impact it had! Why did I hold so much grudge? Why was it a matter of shame when
        used on me? Maybe because I valued my identity as a straight male and didn’t want a taint on it. Well, if that
        were the case, why do I value the straight male identity so much but disgraced homosexuality so much? Just
        because I don’t belong to that minority doesn’t mean I can demean them. Also how do I know I am a straight
        male at such a young age? Now that I am 18, I am quite sure I don’t belong to LGBTQ community. People of
        LGBTQ community were suppressed from ancient times. They had the fatal threat if they were to come out as
        one. There is a huge backlash from society even to this day. Before writing this, I asked my mom if I were to
        say “I am gay and don’t want to marry a woman but a man what would you do?” to which she replied “Do as
        you want; you’ve got too big and mighty for us and to listen to us. You have no respect for society.” These were
        her exact words but in Nepali. Why is being, what one wants which is a bit different from the general mass a
        disgrace to the society. One cannot have a choice of what they want!
      </p>
      <p>
        The culture and practices of the society
        needs a reform. Reform doesn’t occur with a snap of a finger but by constant progress. That’s the reason education
        is important. But wait, my mother is a literate person. So is the teacher that laughed at the homophobic
        slur back in my primary school. So, are the lot of homophobic personality but why does homophobia still exist?
        Doesn’t being educated mean personal development, having the ability to determine right and wrong and
        adopt right things while giving up on wrong things? What’s wrong with LGBTQ that even the literate people
        choose to not acknowledge them? Women were suppressed for a long time in our country back then but that
        rate has dropped significantly now. All thanks to all the awareness and education. We’ve been hearing the
        term Woman Empowerment ever since we could read texts and understand them. But have we ever heard of
        the term LGBTQ empowerment or anything
        such? We’ve given countless speeches, written
        multiple times, and studied in academic
        books about women empowerment. We’ve all
        been said women are equal to men or men and
        women are two sides of a coin in the society.
        Why did we forget the third side, the edge of
        the coin the LGBTQ community? I wouldn’t
        blame Baby Boomers or Generation X if they
        were homophobic or transphobic but in this
        rapidly developing age of Internet if Millennials
        and Generation Z are homophobic or
        transphobic you are not educated. Just having
        academic qualification doesn’t mean you’re
        educated! Browsing through the social media
        and internet, I’ve seen a lot of hate for people
        of LGBTQ community. Hating someone for
        being themselves is not wrong but going to
        extreme measures just to prove your hate by
        causing them mental and even physical harm
        is the worst thing anyone could do! This is not
        always the case though. I’ve also seen people
        coming out as a member of LGBTQ considering
        the negative backlash from the illiterate
        people. I hope in the coming days the illiteracy
        with subsequently drop and this country
        would be a better place for everyone regardless
        of their gender or sexual preferences. Live
        and let live!

    <header>HOW NORMAL IS THE NEW NORMAL</header>
    <article>
      <p>Everyone’s on the cliff edge of
      normal. Everyone finds life
      an utter nightmare sometimes
      and there’s no normal way
      of dealing with it. This statement
      from the novel “Am I Normal Yet”
      written by Holly Bourne says a lot
      about being normal. According to
      it, there is nothing such as ‘Normal’
      and everybody is always at the
      edge of normal in some situations
      which are sudden and unexpected.
      We don’t deal with those situations
      in a normal way; we deal with them
      in an eccentric way and that eccentric
      or odd way is not normal. The
      unusual way which is not normal
      now becomes the new normal later. 
    </p>
    <p> Adaptability is one of the greatest
        reasons for the survival of mankind
        and adaptation involves change.This
        change was caused by the Global
        Pandemic of Novel CoronaVirus
        (COVID-19). Taking the lives of
        more than 2.5 million people, this
        pandemic has impacted mankind
        in every field i.e physically, mentally
        and socially. In the world where
        socialization was marked so important,
        the word “Social Distancing” got
        introduced. The fear changed people
        and introduced the world; The new
        Normal. We all knew about the existence
        of the internet from the very
        beginning but now, it has become
        a key factor in terms of education
        and business as well, with ‘The new
        Normal’ giving topmost priority to
        the health sector all over the globe.
    </p>
    <p> For me; as a student, going to school
        and attending physical-classes was
        normal but now, sitting everyday
        in front of my laptop
        with my webcam
        on to attend
        my online classes
        is the new normal.
    </p>
    <p> Turning the living
        rooms of people
        into office cubicles
        from the idea of
        what we now call
        ‘Work From Home’
        is the new normal.
    </p>
    <p> Seeing the empty streets of
        Kathmandu is the new normal.
        And the N-95 masks have become
        as important as our identity cards.
    </p>
    <p> By now, people have started to
        adapt with the new normal and
        are getting familiar with the word
        “online” because things are now
        changing gradually including online
        classes, online interviews, online
        entrance and even online parties.
        This may sound a little funny
        but people have also started to
        host parties in zoom celebrating
        from their respective residences.
        And yes, this is the New Normal.
    </p>
    <p> The pandemic has also brought a
        slight change in the way of practicing
        our culture too. The Kumari
        Jatra, where thousands of people
        gather to pull the Kumari’s chariot,
        The Living Goddess walked on
        her own.This is the new normal.
    </p>
    <p> The poor people have greatly been
        affected by this new normal. Their
        situations have gotten worse. Experts
        have also predicted that
        the GDP growth of 2020-21 is
        likely to be negative. The whole
        world is greatly affected by it.
    </p>
    <p> 
      We can’t deny the fact that nothing
      but only the change is permanent.
      Everything has got a positive
      and a negative side too. People
      who used to depend on restaurants
      for food have now started cooking
      for themselves.The air quality
      of cities has been the best of its
      decade in 2020. People who could
      hardly spend time with their family
      have now got time to stay with
      them. Such are the positive sides.
      Adaptability is one of the greatest
      reasons for the survival of ma kind.
    </p>
    <p>“Life is a series of natural
      and spontaneous changes.
      Don’t resist them; that only
      creates sorrow. Let reality be
      reality. Let things flow naturally
      forward in whatever
      way they like.”</p>

    <header>STRING THEORY</header>
    <article>
      <p>What is the
        true nature of
        the universe?
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer the question, humans
        came up with stories to describe
        the world. The more humans learn
        about the universe the more complicated
        it becomes. String theory is
        also one of the famous theories on
        the nature of everything .
        We are always amazed when we understand
        the reality of nature. The
        bizarre creatures, landscapes, complex
        protein robots and the whole
        reality is made up of molecules
        and even smaller units, atoms. We
        thought they were the final layer
        of reality until elementary particles
        were discovered. Simply known as
        elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem now is that we can no
        longer see them . To see an object
        we need light , an electromagnetic
        wave. This wave hits the surface of
        the object and gets reflected back
        to the eye. The wave carries information
        from the object which
        your brain uses to create an image.
        So you can’t see anything without
        interacting with it. This is not the
        problem with most things as we
        can see them. But particles are very
        very small, so small that the electromagnetic
        waves we see are too
        big to touch them. So we can’t see
        them. We can try to solve this by
        creating electromagnetic waves of
        much smaller wavelengths but more
        wavelengths mean more energy. So
        when we touch a particle with more
        energy it alters it . So we can’t measure
        elementary particles precisely.
        This fact is known as Heisenbergs’s
        Uncertainty Principle . It is the basic
        principle of all quantum physics
        . We just know that particles exist as
        we cannot see them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, the theory of point particles
        originated .It is a hypothesis
        saying that the particle is in a certain
        point in space having a certain
        charge and mass . With this theory
        the Physicists could carry out all the
        calculations.This theory was called
        quantum theory and solved many
        problems .
      </p>
      <p>
        With this theory some properties of
        elements were tested and proved to
        be accurate upto 0.0000000000002%.
        In quantum mechanics all physical
        forces are carried out by certain
        particles. There is no precise way
        to measure things in the quantum
        world. The story of gravity doesn’t
        work with the story of quantum
        physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the string theory was born.
        String theory describes many different
        elementary particles as modes
        of vibration of a string. String theory
        unified all fundamental forces of
        the universe. String theory requires
        10 dimensions to work out but our
        universe has 4 dimensions. No one
        was able to convert the dimensions
        of string theory into dimensions of
        our own universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, string theory was not accepted
        by the scientists but string theory
        has been a major step in revealing
        the truth about quantum gravity.
        If this theory is proved then we can
        figure out how black holes work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, string theory was created
        to solve Heisenberg’s Uncertainty
        principle and perform quantum calculations
        which was later rejected by
        the scientists.

    <header>PROS AND CONS OF ONLINE CLASSES</header>
    <!--    <header>Pros and Cons of Online Classes</header> -->
    <article>
      <p>Have you been more benefited or
        harmed more by your major learning
        platform? The reader is expected to
        have found their answer at the end of this
        writing. Getting to interact with the world,
        being able to gobble the information that
        we thought was only possible by physical
        means is an achievement itself. Today, we
        have people from the other side of the globe
        taking classes that they could not physically
        go and afford. The main idea of online classes
        is, education being accessible to all people
        at all times. It is giving an opportunity
        for us to learn despite our physical boundaries.
        It is more convenient than ever before.
        Today, if someone wishes to go and find a
        programming course on the internet, they
        will find tons of it. But, if you go looking for
        it in your locality, there is a possibility that
        you might not get one. This is after all helping
        people have the freedom to explore the
        vast ocean of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>Do you remember
        how last year you were so tired while returning
        back from your educational institution?
        And yes, now you don’t have the trouble of
        traveling from one place to the other. This
        not only ends up saving hours that you sent
        in buses or trains but also your energy. This
        will help us to be more productive. You will
        end up eating more homemade foods. You
        evolve into a healthier being. But, sadly not
        everyone has access to technology even if
        we are living in the 21st century. There are
        thousands or maybe millions who haven’t
        got the opportunity to experience a mobile
        phone on their own. The issue of the internet
        does not leave our back. We have connectivity
        issues and to those who can’t join
        it is enough to spoil their mood for the day.
        And if this is a long-term issue then, the
        access to education will have a full stop for
        the time being. It’s difficult to feel the vibe
        of 10 people in the room, isn’t it? There is
        so much energy when someone is speaking
        to you in a physical room. But unfortunately,
        it is not really possible. There is always
        this void in your heart, that if that person
        was there with you, you would pat them a
        certain way on their back or spread your
        warm hugs.
      </p>
      <p>We as students have certainly
          felt this. Not just this, but we have a headache
          because we have been looking at the
          screen for an extended period of time that
          we were certainly not trained for. Staying in
          the same chair and staring at the screen also
          tends to add up to the amount of time we
          spend being physically inactive. That can be
          a major drawback to our health. To sum up
          all the above-mentioned points, the online
          class has its own flaws and beautiful side to
          offer the world.

    <header>LUNATIC TO SENSIBLE</header>
    <article>
      <p>They had told me, “Life is what you make
        of it.” But how could that be true? I had always
        tried to make life the absolute best. Yet
        that never worked. So I believed that life is
        not what you make of it. In some twisted
        way, life is whatever life wants to be. I ended
        wondering where my life would end. And
        whether it is the path declared by destiny!
        My life was living hell; I was suffocated and
        dying within.
      </p>
      <p>It was daybreak when I woke up with the
          beautiful sun was gilding everything around
          me. I decided to go hunting for Pokémon. I
          saw a group of teenagers with cool outfits
          with phones in their hands. I walk to them.
          “Are you guys playing Pokémon go?” With
          a curious voice, they looked at me. Ripped
          jeans, T-shirt, oversized jacket with a phone
          in my hand. “Yeah! We are! If you are too
          then this place is good, you can get lots of
          Pokémon. A guy twice my age replied. “Perhaps
          you can join us. It will be fun to make
          new friends.” They all nodded their heads.
          Why did I trust them so doubtlessly? This
          was how it all started. After that, we started
          hanging out. I started missing my classes.
          It wasn’t any longer I started smoking,
          trying drugs, and getting high every day. In
          the blink of an eye, I was holding a cigarette
          with the hands I used to hold a pen with. I
          was in love with my new life, always trying
          new things calling them adventures. Crossing
          boundaries which I called doing crazy
          stuff, I was blindly flowing with that freedom
          that I forget to rest for a moment and
          analyze what am I doing? I was alone with
          my decisions with no one there to help me.
          In hopes of gaining a cool life, I was destroying
          myself. I was losing everything. One
          night, I hit a girl with an empty bottle. My
          memory is a bit clouded must be because
          I was drunk. Before I could wish it was a
          nightmare, I saw my mom’s tears dripping
          down her face and begging for my bail out
          of jail. It was the first time I saw her crying.
          I have someone who cares and loves me
          even though I was worse. I could not have
          said how much time had passed before I
          found myself back with that luminous being
          inside the circle which I had drawn. I
          had known love before, but until that night,
          it also meant fear. That fear, however slight
          I was always a veil. I could see almost everything
          through it, but not the colors. And
          at that moment, with my mother there before
          me, I understood that love was a feeling
          completely bound up with colors, like
          thousands of rainbows. Superimposed one
          to top of the other.
      </p>
      <p>A deep and dark voice inside me viewed
          change everything, to make everything
          okay like it was back then. I realized I was
          living in a world in which I had no place for
          myself. Tomorrow morning, I will be waking
          up with sun gliding everything around
          me with the hope to take the right path
          trying to change lunatic life to a sensible
          one.........!!!

    <header>WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST THE MEDIA. CAN WE ?</header>
    <article>
      <p>“The media is the most powerful entity on Earth.
          They have the power to make the innocent guilty
          and the guilty innocent.Because they control the
          minds of the mass”  -Malcolm X.
      </p>
      <p>Just imagine, if the scenario of the media as a whole
        was a movie and we all were the crowd watching
        and believing it. Maybe we all are justifying
        our opinions and thoughts solely on what the media
        want us the interpret.
        Today that can obviously be happening. We never
        know how are our minds are being manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>There might be thousands of fake reports. Fake reports
        that are being published by the media that is
        considered truthful. Can you believe, In 1960s the
        sugar industry paid Harvard scientists to promote
        saturated fat as the main cause of heart disease?This
        report has also led to a hypothesis being believed
        and followed for decades.Still today some people
        believe it. Even The United States Dietary Guidelines
        prescribed it.We all were the people being experimented
        upon without us even knowing. This
        was discovered probably after 50 years of timeframe.
        For that, we can consider ourselves as guinea
        pigs.
      </p>
      <p>Isn’t that the influence of the existing media ?
      </p>
      <p>Even today, Coca-Cola has been providing millions
          of dollars as funds to researchers who sought
          to play down the link between sugary drinks and
          obesity. Hopefully, there are some bits and pieces of
          information that is revolving around.
      </p>
      <p>Lets change our perspective from being a viewer to
        a news reporter or the executive head of a media
        company. There are thousands of correspondences ,
        camera person , producer and all others working to
        present the viewers with content. In the age of
        growing media, there are many companies doing
        the same. But the content viewers prefer to check
        out the one that looks the most prepossessing. So
        to meet that goal, there can be misleading or deceptive
        information.
      </p>
      <p>We of course are being able to the know what is
          happening around the world at this very moment
          through media.But everything we see is not the
          truth.

    <header>WOMEN AND NEPALESE SOCIETY</header>
    <article>
      <p>“Being a woman should be your supreme achievement and not
        your deepest fear. Celebrate womanhood, fuel yourself with
        self-confidence and let that fuel empower you to soar towards
        your dreams.”
      </p>
      <p>This is the 21st century. In today’s modern world many things are
          believed to have changed. A century ago, the lives of people around
          the globe was still primitive but within decades, the world has gone
          through a radical change in the sector of health, education, nutrition,
          science and technology. The extraordinary development in
          these fields has resulted in the complex civilization and modernization
          of the society. With this change in time and circumstances,
          the conception, the way of thinking and people’s perspectives have
          changed. A person’s understanding about a particular issue now and
          then has significant gap. People have now developed a gorgeous way
          of life.
      </p>
      <p>Talking about Nepal, our motherland, has also gone
          through a drastic change in everything, from the way of dressing
          to speaking, working, housing and many more within a very short
          period of time. Nepalese people also have developed a broader way
          of thinking and handling issues. The composition of our society
          and its features have changed. The Nepalese society we see now and
          the society that existed when our grandparents were our age have
          a huge difference. Our society has developed a wider point of view
          towards women now.
      </p>
      <p>Just a few decades back, women were treated like toys
          to satisfy her husband’s desires, machines to manufacture children,
          servants to carry out the household chores and clerks to follow the
          boss’s orders. The voices of women were unheard, their feelings were
          suppressed and their words were shoved in their mouth. No freedom
          was granted, not for studying or for expression and primarily
          not for self-decision. The male members in the family were the ones Just a few decades back, women were treated like toys
          to satisfy her husband’s desires, machines to manufacture children,
          servants to carry out the household chores and clerks to follow the
          boss’s orders. The voices of women were unheard, their feelings were
          suppressed and their words were shoved in their mouth. No freedom
          was granted, not for studying or for expression and primarily
          not for self-decision. The male members in the family were the ones
      </p>
      <p>But as time grew, the western society has developed a new and thankfully, a positive
          perspective towards women. They started protesting against inequality. They started professing
          things about men and women being two sides of a single coin, two wheels of a single cart and so
          on. As a result, the world has got a new concept for women and undoubtedly, Nepal too. Eventually,
          women in Nepal started to come out of the house and stand for themselves. They showed the
          society that even women can succeed in every field. They exposed the fact that women are not
          less capable than men. Women can do what a man can and even more. Women can make decisions
          of their own and they deserve respect. After all the ups and downs, the lives of most of the
          women in Nepal has improved. We are now living for ourselves, earning for ourselves and living
          our life to the fullest. Today a woman can be a teacher, a doctor, a nurse, an engineer, a lawyer, an
          astronaut, and the president of a country. Today the Nepalese society treats women as one halves
          of the sky and gives her the respect she deserves. After all we also cannot deny the fact that many
          women are yet to receive their rights and for that, every Nepali has to have a clear mindset. We
          are the youths and we are the beginnings. So, we must develop a healthy attitude and widen the
          horizon of our understanding to change the society for good and empower women.

          what you cook, you shameless!! You’ve cut our
          nose in the society.” Grandma shouted at me.</p>
      <p>She looked at my father and continued “I had
          insisted you earlier to get her married. But you
          didn’t listen to me. I had always told you that
          daughters are like this; mean. Now see what trouble
          your beloved daughter has brought to us! Who
          will marry her now?”</p>
      <p>“She’s just a child mom! I had told you not to take
        her to Chhau goth. She’s too small to understand
        this.” my father supported me.</p>
      <p>“Grandma, it’s not my fault!” I cried.</p>
      <p>“Look, how brave she is. How does she manage
        to speak up after the incident? Look my son, we
        have to get her married within a week otherwise
        this girl can bring us issues. I had told you to remarry
        and have a son. Had you married then, we
        would not have faced this situation today!” My
        grandma continued.</p>
      <p>Tears rolled down my cheeks, I could not listen
        anymore and I went inside.</p>
      <p>My story starts from an incident that occurred a
        week ago. One fine day, I and my friends were going
        to kuwa to fetch water early in the morning.
        We were carrying gagris and were walking slowly
        talking with each other.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, I felt a steady flow of liquid drop through
          my left thigh. I ignored it at first. But then it happened
          again. I had never felt anything like that
          before. I could not understand what was happening
          and how to react. I felt so strange and looked
          GRANDMA, IT’S NOT
          MY FAULT!
          down at my feet. I saw something
          like red splash over my left
          foot and oh gosh that was blood!
          My friends, too looked at my
          feet and they noticed the same.
          We were all of age from 11 to 13
          and no one had felt such thing
          before. I explained what I felt to
          them and one of my friends said
          I was menstruating. She said her
          sister shared it with her.</p>
      <p>I didn’t know what menstruation
        was till then. Yes I didn’t.
        And that was because there was
        no one in my family who would
        talk to me about these matters.
        Moreover, talking about such
        matters is considered sham ful
        in our society. My family is
        small. I live with my father and
        grandmother. My father is a
        farmer. They say, my mother left
        me when I was 6 months old.
        They say grandmother was expecting
        me to be a son but I was
        born. So, she doesn’t care about
        me a lot. She always wanted my
        father to remarry. But he kept
        on refusing.</p>
      <p>After all that, my friends suggested
          me to return home and
          we did the same. They told my
          Grandma about everything that
          happened and then my Grandma
          started shouting at me. I
          was shocked at that moment.
          “What is my fault after all?” I
          started questioning to myself.
          She immediately got into the
          house, got some rags and asked
          me to follow her to chhau goth.
          (Chhau goth is a menstrual hut
          made from wood or stone.)
          Then she told me that I had
          to stay at there for two weeks
          and wouldn’t be able to go to
          our home or school or temple.
          She told that she would bring
          me meals and any other thing
          I needed. She also asked me to
          not look at other males. I agreed
          what she said and spent the day
          there. The day was easy but as it
          grew dark, I got scared. It was
          my first experience after all. At
          night, Grandma once visited me
          with food and asked me not to
          get scared and I’ll be used to with
          it. I had a candle and myself. I
          stayed awake the whole night.
          The next day too, grandmother
          and my friends visited me. They
          wouldn’t touch me. I used to feel
          helpless and suffocated. Similarly,
          the days passed and I started
          getting used to with it. I thought
          days would pass as that. But
          then there was a lot left for me.
          On the second last day, Grandma
          gave me some food and left.
          After having my food, I was
          about to sleep but then, I heard
          some sound through the bush.
          At first, I neglected it thinking it
          might be some insects. But the
          sound became louder and closer.
          I became attentive and I saw
          a huge shadow. That was not
          an animal for sure. The shadow
          grew larger and larger and
          hugged me from behind closing
          my mouth. The candle was
          blown off and I don’t want to recall
          what happened. Later in the
          morning, I came to know that I
          was raped. That news spread as
          fast as wind in the village. They
          tried to hide it but they couldn’t
          and now they’re saying these
          things.</p>
                <p>“What is my fault after all?” I
          question myself all the time.
          Now, I know the answer, my
          fault is that, I’m a girl. Although
          I was lucky to belong from a
          well-educated family and never
          suffered from such practices,
          this is a sample story of many
          girls living in the far western
          region of Nepal. Still many girls
          are forced to stay at Chhau goth
          for two weeks during their first
          menstruation, first childbirth
          and also during their regular
          periods. Because of this many
          girls die of suffocation (especially
          in winter when they try to
          light fire), wild animals’ attack,
          snake bite, etc. Some girls also
          become victim of rape. They
          lack proper menstrual hygiene
          leading to genital infections.
          Women in postnatal stage may
          lack proper nutrition and face
          many health hazards. They do
          so because the secretions during
          menstruation are considered as
          ‘impure’ and they believe that
          if they don’t do so God might
          get angry. Now a days, Nepalese
          government in co-ordination
          with local and provincial
          government is destroying these
          Chhau Goth. There are strict
          legal provisions against this Chhaupadi
          system in our law. But
          still, they practice it in some
          districts of far-western region of
          Nepal. It is necessary to raise the
          awareness against such practices.
          Also, many girls still lack
          menstrual health education and
          that should also be provided.
          There are many such anti-women
          practices around the world
          that make women lag behind.
          Such practices should be eradicated
          through our common efforts.</p>

    <header>THE DARK WEB</header>
    <article>
      <p>Do you search your bank account details at google? Or carry
        monetary transaction through google?</p>
      <p>BUT we get our bank details from the server of bank’s website.
        And here we part the web: one you go for search engines,
        search your query and get results of it and the other
        one anonymous web not accessed by all. So, we term them
        respectively as surface web and deep web.</p>
      <p>‘Dark Web’ is a part of deep web which you do not get access
        via common search engines, instead need a different
        browser to browse it.
        Different browser?</p>
      <p>Yeah! To access the dark web, you need a browser called
        ‘TOR’ (The Onion Router). Browsing through Tor, you
        can hide your own IP address and assign to the IP address
        of another server. So, the word ‘anonymous’ best suits for
        all the stuffs related to Tor and the dark web i.e. when you
        access Tor browser, your IP is anonymous which means it
        gives you an IP unknown to your ISP or google. Tor browser
        is free and you can easily download it from your common
        web browser.</p>
      <p>And here arises the question: Is Tor legal or illegal? Is being
        anonymous while using web accepted in your country?
        It depends on your country’s rule about private network. It
        might be illegal in the countries considering VPNs illegal.
        Although, Tor might me legal, the websites under it may be
        illegal. However, google even sponsors Tor and telling websites
        may be illegal, Facebook also has its website on it. A legitimate
        site ‘Black book’ is considered as the Facebook of To
        r.</p>
      <p>Talking about websites under Tor, they don’t have ‘.com’ or
        ‘.co’ extensions instead, they have ‘.onion’ extension. Since
        an onion has many layers on it, accessing Tor websites consists
        of different layer of sites making it anonymous. The
        browsing through dark web comprises ‘onion routing’.
        Now, ‘what is onion routing?’</p>
      <p>Before that, let us know how social networking community
        runs.</p>
      <p>When we use Facebook, Google and all other social platforms,
        we give some sort of private information to them.
        That is, our contact number, location and so on to access
        us. So, using surface web, we can’t maintain our privacy to
        the level we want. It gets to conclude that we have an open
        source community while using them. But privacy matters!
        Hence the VPN (Virtual Private Network) was made into
        practice.</p>
      <p>But, when we use VPN, our ISP may not be known what
        we are accessing but our specific VPN provider can surely
        be acknowledged. And here VPN also fails.
        Now it’s clear that onion routing can maintain better level
        of privacy through dark web.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dark web has onion routing comprising numerous
        VPNs, so when you access certain website on it, the
        website searches you how you’re accessing it but due to different
        VPNs (proxy servers), it becomes difficult for you to
        be traced. And hence it’s anonymous.</p>
      <p>To be clear on this, suppose, you visited “thefarak.onion”
        on Tor, and also suppose Tor used 100 proxy servers for you
        to finally access this website. Now, “thefarak.onion” tries to
        know how you are accessing it but for that it should go onserver1…
        server2…..server3…..and so on and it couldn’t
        know through which server are you accessing it. So, you’re
        anonymous. This is how onion routing occurs.
        If browsing through Tor is that anonymous, how can we
        think of being hacked or being attacked by illegal works in
        dark web?</p>
      <p>Being anonymous is both best and worst for Tor.
          When you create a dark web site with “.onion” in Tor, and
          if someone get access to it, your computer itself acts as the
          server and you need no hosts. You can be the host yourself.
          To be clear, when I create a website in Tor and if someone
          goes on my site, I create the web service to him/her through
          Tor. Since my computer acts as the server itself, the entered
          data on my site can be accessed by me. So, you are likely to
          be hacked and since it’s anonymous, you don’t know what’s
          going on.</p>

      <p>And finally, it’s better not performing internet banking
        through is and not providing real identity to unknown
        websites of it. Malware attacks, drug dealing, selling and
        buying hacked accounts, viruses, operational and financial
        data theft and other type of attacks occur. So, it’s better to
        be careful. If you want a private environment for browsing
        internet, accessing through dark web could be the good
        choice.</p>

    <header>Nuclear Disarmament: The Efforts and
    Limitations of the Century</header>
    <article>
      <p>It has been over
        75 years since
        the events in Hiroshima
        and Nagasaki
        took place
        which shook the
        whole world to the
        ground, yet, international
        peace
        is nowhere to be
        found completely
        till date. Nuclear
        disarmament is
        extremely necessary
        to achieve
        World Peace. Experts
        also believe
        that the two major
        threats in front of us are Climate
        Change and Nuclear Weapons
        and they have been urging for
        complete disarmament.</p>
      <p>The term
        denuclearization is also used to
        describe the process leading to
        complete nuclear disarmament.
        Disarmament and International
        Security Committee (DISEC),
        the first committee of UN General
        Assembly was formed in 1945
        to address international concerns
        for the “Establishment of a Commission
        to Deal with the Problems
        Raised by the Discovery of
        Atomic Energy.” This committee
        is concerned with the issues relating
        to disarmament, global
        challenges and threats to peace
        that affect the international committee
        and strives for solutions to
        the challenges in the international
        security
        regime.
        The Committee
        comprises
        of all
        m e m b e r
        nations of
        the United
        Nations. Even though its order is
        limited to recommendations, it
        has proven to be one of the most
        influential and prominent bodies
        in the United Nations, as its resolutions
        deal with some of the
        most tortuous topics in the international
        community.</p>
      <p>Efforts and
          progress are ongoing; however, it
          is very complicated as there are
          shifts in numbers of weapons and
          the overarching policies governing
          these weapons are relevant.
          In terms of quantitative reductions,
          measurable steps have been
          undertaken by NWS (Nuclear
          Weapon Reduction) both unilaterally
          and bilaterally.</p>
      <p>DISEC showcases very delicate
          issues that plague the world today,
          and delegates should treat
          them as such. Their controversial,
          hot-button topics attract a wave
          of delegates itching to solve issues
          with new technology, databases,
          and intelligence. Some common
          topics that we want to see appear
          on the floor of the Disarmament
          and International Security
          Committee are Cyber Security
          and Warfare, Ethics of Drones,
          Fourth Generation Warfare, Nuclear
          Proliferation, Illicit Arms
          Trade, and the Illegal Drug Trade.</p>

    <header>A FULL STOP TO GENDER PREJUDICE</header>
    <article>
      <p>“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”</p>
      <p>Over the years, everywhere around the globe, irrespective
        of all political, economic, cultural,
        religious environment, Human Rights are breached
        and violated on grounds of people’s real or perceived
        opinions on sexual orientation or gender identity. Although
        many countries have introduced laws against
        any form of discrimination based on human rights
        concerning the gender issues, the implementation
        seems to fail in several aspects.</p>
      <p>As mentioned in UN Deceleration
          “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity
          and rights.” But the abuse and injustice against
          LGBTQ+ community is excessively prevalent across
          the globe. As of now, only 29 countries have legalized
          same sex marriage. Similarly, Homophobia and
          transphobia can’t even be presented with statics. Although
          the IE SOGI, by UNHRC on 2016 have been
          working on providing member states with statics for
          prevention, prosecution and punishment for violation
          of basic human rights if LGBTQ community. For a
          long time, homosexuality has been subjected to intense
          forms of marginalization and social and political
          exclusion everywhere in the world. Homosexual
          behaviours been and continue to be criminalized by
          various legal provisions, and in addition to that, in the
          daily life people with the sexual preference have been
          excluded from multiple social benefits and have had
          to endure social stigmatization.
          And in the most extreme
          cases results in campaigns of
          extermination against these
          populations. This situation of
          homosexuals has been justified
          via conception because
          these people had been considered
          abnormal or immoral
          because they display a sexual
          orientation which is different
          from the majority of the population.
          Even the
          government has failed to address
          the cases of bigotry
          and promulgate the laws and
          practices effectively.</p>
      <p>Likewise, various countries surpass other form of discriminations
          including workplace gender biasness,
          domestic violence. Hate crime, social ostracism, sexual
          objectification, sexism etc. Traditionally, federal law
          only prohibited discrimination based on race, ethnicity,
          national origin, religion, and sex. As a result, many
          states went beyond the federal law to offer protection
          against discriminatory acts involving sexual orientation
          or gender identity.</p>
      <p>Hence, the persecution of people because of their
          sexual orientation and gender identity is not a new
          phenomenon. It is only in more recent years that a
          growing number of asylum claims have been made
          by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex
          (LGBTI) individuals. This has necessitated greater
          awareness among decision-makers of the specific experiences
          of LGBTI asylum-seekers and a deeper examination
          of the legal questions involved. Inclusive of
          the gender rights which include the biased behaviours
          to men, women and LGBTIQ community, the provided
          agenda is crucial enough to be discussed within the
          committee for the countries to bring pragmatic and
          possible resolution after an ample discussion and argumentation.</p>
